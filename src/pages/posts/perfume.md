I didn't know that smelling different scents would make me so happy! I was unsure what to expect from ScentOn's perfume making class in Seoul's Gangnam district. 하지만 지금 (But now) I may have become hooked on making my own beauty products. Such an activity brings me joy akin to arts and crafts, or cooking!

ScentOn has a product line called Scentlier. One could purchase Scentlier's perfumes on their ecommerce site, alternatively you can be Ms. Shoblom (or one of her friends) and get a custom personalized Scentlier perfume complete with an unforgetabble in-person experience! The "니콜" scent that I made was 80% of a base pre-concocted by scenton's perfumers, and 20% tangerine, rose, peru balsam, and cedarwood. My friends and I were instructed to let our perfume creations age for 10 days before use. In addition to the 500 ml bottle of perfume, we smelled many different types of synthetic scents, plus we learned that smelling yourself acts as a really good nose 'palate' cleanser!

To my readers - I wish there was tech to digitally share my perfume smell! Until next time... 감사합니다 (thankyou) for stopping by!
