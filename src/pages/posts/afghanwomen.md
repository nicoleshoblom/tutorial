# Men and Women Are Equal

Before the Taliban took over Afghanistan in 2021 women were allowed to work in a diverse number of fields. Since the takeover, women may now only work in a scant few fields, like healthcare and customs. Technically speaking, Afghan women are not allowed in public green spaces, and they must be accompanied by a man whenever they leave their house. Worst of all, young women and girls are not allowed to go to school.

At her powerful talk at Heyground next to 뚝섬역, Ms. Alison Mariam Davidian of UN Women explained that half of the Taliban believe that the ulimate goal for Afghans is to reach heaven. However, to do so one must be protected from sin. A seemingly easy way to do this is through segragation of the sexes. So, women and girls can't go out in public and can't attend school until women-only public places and women-only schools are built. 

A rapid decline of women's rights could happen anywhere, and some argue that there are similarities between what has happened in Afghanistan to what is happening in 미국 (the United States). In fact just today, the US was added to the Global Human Rights Watchlist. I am not afraid to say that I am a feminist, and that I am raising my 2 sons to also be feminists. But as I was painfully reminded of today, not being afraid to be a feminist - to be a woman - is a privledge that I take for granted.

Ms. Davidian explained that to fight the dire situation of women in Afghanistan, there needs to be funding, protection, and empowerment. Funding of organizations, such as UN Women. Protection of women by for example, protesting women injustices in the moment. And empowerment of women to be in leadership positions to make decisions and influence policy.

To my readers - Whoever you are stand up for women's rights and 고마워요 for stopping by.
